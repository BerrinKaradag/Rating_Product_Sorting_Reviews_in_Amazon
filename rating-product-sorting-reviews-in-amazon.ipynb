The solution to this problem means providing more customer satisfaction for the e-commerce site, highlighting the product for the sellers and a smooth shopping experience for the buyers. Another problem is the correct ordering of the comments given to the products. Since the prominence of misleading comments will directly affect the sales of the product, it will cause both financial loss and loss of customers. In the solution of these 2 basic problems, the e-commerce site and the sellers will increase their sales while the customers will complete the purchasing journey smoothly.\n","\n","This dataset, which contains Amazon product data, includes product categories and various metadata.
